This tutorial uses [`build`](https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/) to interface with `setuptools`.
`build` can be installed in a variety of ways:

- install with Homebrew and invoke with `pyproject-build`
- install in pipenv-managed virtualenv with `pipenv run pip install --upgrade build` and invoke with
  `pipenv run build ...`.
