# Pytest structure: Discussion with Pierce

## Discussion

Are there pytest users out there who create `setup.py` and do `pip install -e
.`, so that the tests run against an installed package (that is sym-linked back
to the working copy in the repository)?  The example from here
(https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html#install-package-with-pip)
says to put this in `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(name="PACKAGENAME", packages=find_packages())
```

      [`setuptools`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html)
      and `setup.py`.
- [ ] Create a package inside this project and install it in editable mode.  See
      how changes are mirrored between source and package files and how `import`
      statements are affected by changes in `setup.py`.

I havenâ€™t encountered the methodology of installing a package first before
testing its internal contents, and I could use a hand understanding the merits
of the approach.

This is a pattern I have used. Installing the package in `-e/editable` mode
"only has to be done once" inside a python `venv`. One benefit of using
`setup.py` is that it strips paths for you. So if you have
`src/my_project/__init__.py` ... and you pass a `package_dir` argument to
`setup()`, something like

```python
setup(
  name="mypackage",
  packages=find_packages(where="src"),
  package_dir={"": "src"}
)
```

Then after pip installing, you can `import my_project` instead of `import
src.my_project`.  The same path stripping is relevant for tests.

The alternative would be to set `PYTHONPATH` to your local package
directory(ies). 

One gotcha is that after you do `pip install -e` . you can't rely on the output
of pip freeze to capture 3rd party dependencies. But this isn't a problem with
pipenv and `Pipfile/Pipfile.lock`.
